# EMMF - EasyMasssMailForwarder
A little Python script to forward all unread E-Mails in a specified Mailbox to a infinitely expandable list of E-Mail addresses.

This is a Python project, so it has to be run with [Python](https://www.python.org/).
This project was developed with Python 3.6 so no other compatibility is guaranteed.
